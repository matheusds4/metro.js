# Button navigable

DOM elements that are navigable through buttons (typically the arrow keys) contain the cascading class indicated by the `BUTTON_NAVIGABLE` constant in `com.sweaxizone.metro/utils`.

That is useful if you want to support button/arrow navigation yourself in your user interface and must not double handle these buttons/arrows (which are already handled by this Metro design library).
