# Scrolling

## Horizontal scrolling

- Container components have a `wheelHorizontal` option which when set to `true` makes horizontal scrolling through the mouse wheel possible, with a fast transition and pressure.

## Vertical scrolling

- Enhance wheel scrolling on vertical containers through the `wheelVertical` option, by setting it to `true`.
  - Add `wheelVertical` to any parents as needed, since they may get the most scroll available instead.
