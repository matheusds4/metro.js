# Core tiles

## Core.detect()

Tiles:

- *Called on React.js effect involving changed properties (x, y, size).*
- *Called on React.js empty-dependencies effect cleanup.*

Groups:

- *Called on React.js effect involving changed properties (index, label).*
- *Called on React.js empty-dependencies effect cleanup.*h.

## Group label

- [ ] Editing

## Tile drag-n-drop

Trick to use: Draggable needs to drag the tileDND element, not the tile itself. For this, simply dispatch virtual `mousedown` and `touchdown` events with corresponding data.

## Groups

Group drag-n-drop mimmicks tiles a bit in how the Draggable instance is created, with some subtle differences.

- [x] Label
- [x] Label > touch start
  - [x] Edit (short-touch)
  - [x] Trigger drag-n-drop (long-held)
    - [ ] Trigger events
- [x] Label > mouse down
  - [x] Edit (short click)
  - [x] Trigger drag-n-drop (after short-delta)
    - [ ] Trigger events

Drag-n-drop handlers (DND.ts):

- [x] _group_drag_start
- [ ] _group_drag_move
- [ ] _group_drag_end
  - [ ] If group was removed, trigger `groupDragEnd` and exit.
  - [ ] `groupDraggable![1].destroy()`
  - [ ] `groupDraggable=null`
  - [ ] Set `dragging=false`
  - [ ] Unassign group's Z-index.
  - [ ] Rearrange (because its position is invalidated)
