# Core tiles

- [ ] `.direction` getter/setter
  - [ ] changes the layout and re-detect past DOM nodes (e.g. clear things up and add groups and tiles back based on past data).

## Core.detect()

- [ ] Note that `detect()` must defer detection. It will collect multiple nodes and after a 7ms timeout it should detect these nodes and clear up again the detection list.

Tiles:

- [ ] Contributes a newly-added DOM tile, or detects moving X/Y, resizing and group transfer (look at parent).
  - [ ] If the tile was previously detected for a different layout limit/direction, then disregard whether X/Y has changed or not.
- [ ] ... or, given a removed DOM tile, remove tile from state, remove parent group if empty and rearrange groups.
  - *This is usually called on React.js effect cleanup.*

Groups:

- [ ] Contributes a newly-added DOM group, or detects label change.
- [ ] ... or, given a removed DOM group, remove group from state and rearrange groups.
  - *This is usually called on React.js effect cleanup.*
- [ ] Group indices are based in DOM order among sibling `TileGroup`s (e.g. disregard `TileDND`).
