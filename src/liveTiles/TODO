# Core tiles

## Core.detect()

Tiles:

- *Called on React.js effect involving changed properties (x, y, size).*
- *Called on React.js empty-dependencies effect cleanup.*
- [ ] Attach mouse down/click/touch down/touch end handlers on tile addition for click, check and drag-n-drop events
  - [ ] Trigger click
  - [ ] Trigger contextMenu
  - [ ] Drag-n-drop only occurs if `Core.dragEnabled=true`
  - [ ] (un-)checking tiles only occurs if `Core.checkEnabled=true`

Groups:

- *Called on React.js effect involving changed properties (x, y, size).*
- *Called on React.js empty-dependencies effect cleanup.*
- [ ] Contributes a newly-added DOM group, or detects label change, or reorders group (based on the `data-index` attribute changing from state's index).
  - [ ] If `data-index` is `> groups.length` (that is, it's not an existing group's place neither the last place available) then trigger a `moveGroup` event to put it at the last position.
  - [ ] If another group's index, then trigger `moveGroup` for the other group it's swaping index with.

## Group label

- [ ] Editing

## Tile drag-n-drop

Trick to use: Draggable needs to drag the tileDND element, not the tile itself. For this, simply dispatch virtual `mousedown` and `touchdown` (with the same device ID as the tile's touch) events with corresponding coordinates and touch collections (touches/targetTouches/changedTouches).

- [ ] Make tile invisible while dragging (and tileDND visible)
- [ ] Touch start
  - [ ] Trigger click
  - [ ] Trigger check
  - [ ] Trigger drag-n-drop (long-held)
    - [ ] Trigger events
- [ ] Mouse down
  - [ ] Trigger click
  - [ ] Trigger check
  - [ ] Trigger drag-n-drop (after short-delta)
    - [ ] Trigger events

More:

- [ ] Empty checked tiles on drag start, triggering `checkedChange`
- [ ] Note that the tile may be removed while dragging

## Group drag-n-drop

Group drag-n-drop mimmicks tiles a bit in how the Draggable instance is created, with some subtle differences.

- [ ] Label > touch start
  - [ ] Edit
  - [ ] Trigger drag-n-drop (long-held)
    - [ ] Trigger events
- [ ] Label > mouse down
  - [ ] Edit
  - [ ] Trigger drag-n-drop (after short-delta)
    - [ ] Trigger events

- [ ] Note that the group may be removed while dragging
