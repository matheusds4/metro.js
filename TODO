# Live tiles

- [ ] Done
- [ ] Support background-based live tiles by creating masks (which also alter while dragging a tile), similiar to Windows Phone.
  - [ ] In that case, the container of groups should display a background that serves as the "border". That container will also contain the masks that warp to the parent's background.
  - [ ] Mask off group's remaining empty area.

# Icons

- [ ] Trash
- [ ] Menu (hamburguer icon)
- [ ] Provide a React.js component for each native icon (some already have, but not all of them) with an `Icon` suffix.

# Themes

- [ ] Provide more theme variants.
