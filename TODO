Each item must contain three tags: the icon, the label, and the ending (usually a shortcut or submenu indicator). All of them, except the label, are wrapped in a `span`. For an item representing a submenu, there is an extra tag being the sub-popover-menu.

```
<PopoverMenu>
  <Item>
    <span><Icon native={NativeIcons.INTERNET_EXPLORER}/></span>
    <Label>Internet Explorer</Label>
    <span>Ctrl+E</span>
  </Item>
  <Separator/>
  <Item submenu>
    <span></span>
    <Label>Submenu</Label>
    <span><Indicator/></span>
    <PopoverMenu>
      <Item>
        <span></span>
        <Label>Item 1</Label>
        <span></span>
      </Item>
    </PopoverMenu>
  </Item>
</PopoverMenu>
```

# Live tiles

- [ ] Done
- [ ] Support background-based live tiles by creating masks (which also alter while dragging a tile), similiar to Windows Phone.
  - [ ] In that case, the container of groups should display a background that serves as the "border". That container will also contain the masks that warp to the parent's background.
  - [ ] Mask off group's remaining empty area.

# Icons

- [ ] Trash
- [ ] Menu (hamburguer icon)

# Themes

- [ ] Provide more theme variants.
