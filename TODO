# PopoverMenu

- [x] Done
- [70%] Convert position/max-width/height to rem after transition
- [ ] Observe dynamically added items to optionally resize the PopoverMenu.

# ComboBox

- [x] Done
  - [ ] Fix little border-ish-jump at the end of the ComboBox open transition.
- [ ] Future: Virtual list support (e.g. support displaying a loading indicator either at the start or end of the dropdown and add/eliminate options as appropriate maintaining correct V-scroll)

# DatePicker

- [ ] Done

# TabBar

- [ ] Done

# Live tiles

- [ ] Done
  - [ ] Propagate tile click event to right child
  - [ ] Propagate tile context menu event to right child
  - [ ] Propagate group-label right click event to right child
  - [ ] Group/tile components are detected for the parent live tiles component on initialization.
  - [ ] Group/tile components are detected for the parent live tiles component on React.js cleanup/destruction.
  - [ ] Group/tile components must signal the parent live tiles component when certain properties change (like x, y, size... group index)
  - [ ] Icon+label tiles should be displayed like that: (note that icon may be a logo as a rectangle)
    - [ ] label = div with display=flex, flex-direction=column, justify-content=end
  - [ ] Icon+label tiles = hide label in small tiles (1x1)
  - [ ] Label+icon tiles use a subsubheading label. Icon should be way smaller than in icon+label tiles. They should be just "icon" tiles for small tiles (1x1).
  - [ ] Tile X/Y may be omitted or -1
  - [ ] Support size-conditional live content pages
    - [ ] One page can target multiple sizes (e.g. support attributes like `size="< wide"` (less-than), greater-than and exact (`=` prefix optional); the page's `size` attribute will result in multiple class names like `.medium` and `.wide`)
  - [ ] Icon/logo size should be more based in percentage
    - [ ] Icon size = percent inside 57x57 logical pixels.
    - [ ] Logo size = percent inside horizontal 172 logical pixels.
  - [x] Optional `TilePlus` controller with `.checked()`, `.checkAll()`, `.uncheckAll()` and `.inlineGroupsAvailable()` methods
- [ ] Transparent tiles should have a drop shadow

# Page

Way contextual; skinning and behavior relies on surrounding container. It is basically used within live tiles.
