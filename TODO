# Live tiles

# Themes

- [ ] Provide more theme presets. (Maybe, for light and dark, provide different primary colors (affecting also sliders).)
- [ ] Provide a ThemePreset enumeration and allow converting it into a theme preset `Theme` object. (Useful for theme reuse across apps based on internal data.)
