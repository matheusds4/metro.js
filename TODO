- [ ] Observe dynamically added items to optionally resize the PopoverMenu.

Each item must contain three tags: the icon, the label, and the ending (usually a shortcut or submenu indicator). All of them, except the label, are wrapped in a `span`. For an item representing a submenu, there is a following sibling tag being the sub-popover-menu.

```
<PopoverMenu>
  <Item>
    <span><Icon type={NativeIcons.INTERNET_EXPLORER}/></span>
    <Label>Internet Explorer</Label>
    <span>Ctrl+E</span>
  </Item>
  <Separator/>
  <Item>
    <span></span>
    <Label>Submenu</Label>
    <span><Indicator/></span>
  </Item>
  <PopoverMenu>
    <Item>
      <span></span>
      <Label>Item 1</Label>
      <span></span>
    </Item>
  </PopoverMenu>
</PopoverMenu>
```

# VSlider

# AppBar

- [ ] May display a hamburguer button in portrait screen orientation.
- [ ] May place items out of the hamburguer button regardless of screen orientation (for example, action icons)

# Live tiles

- [ ] Done
- [ ] Support background-based live tiles by creating masks (which also alter while dragging a tile), similiar to Windows Phone.
  - [ ] In that case, the container of groups should display a background that serves as the "border". That container will also contain the masks that warp to the parent's background.
  - [ ] Mask off group's remaining empty area.

# Page

Way contextual; skinning and behavior relies on surrounding container. It is basically used within live tiles.

- [ ] Done

- [ ] Trash
- [ ] Menu (hamburguer icon)

# Themes
